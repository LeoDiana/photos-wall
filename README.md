## 📝 Note About Firebase

For the deployed version, Firebase has been removed and replaced with local storage (sessionStorage). This means:

- All your photos and settings are stored locally in your browser
- When you reload the page, your work will be cleared (this is by design for privacy)

This makes the app super lightweight and perfect for quick photo wall creation without any setup or authentication
needed.
